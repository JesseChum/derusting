# Items to Refresh on:

As you work through this exercise, write down anything that you needed to look up or struggled to remember here. It can be just a word or two (e.g. "joining strings"). You can use this as a guide of what to make extra sure you're refreshed on before exams and interviews.

- I need to work on specfically Arrays as I had a hard time with that practice. I seem to do just fine as I find it easier to do ArrayLists.
